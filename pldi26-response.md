Suggestions:

- shorten the section on prophecies
  (note: prophets are also useful for other things)
  (we could detail only one of Wise and Multiplexed,
   show less specifications)

- move Vertex to an appendix

- use the extra space to present and explain the OCaml APIs before the
  Zoo specifications, and the use-cases for some of our specification
  choices (in particular: having both persistent and
  non-persistent propositions).

We believe that this would be an approachable amount of work, because
we already have a long/extended version which has more content and in
particular the extra explanations you suggested. It is a matter of
finding space to insert this content.
