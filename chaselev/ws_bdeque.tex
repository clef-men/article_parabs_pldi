\subsection{Bounded work-stealing deque}

In the bounded variant, the infinite array is replaced with a finite circular array.
As a consequence, the convenient infinite representation goes away and tedious reasoning about circular array slices is required.
However, the logical states and transitions as well as the prophecy mechanism are essentially the same.

It is an open question whether we could factorize part of the verification through a well-chosen abstraction that could be instantiated both with infinite and circular arrays.
One certainty is that this is not possible without slightly altering the implementation of the infinite variant: in \c{steal}, the front cell is read after performing the update in the infinite variant, which would be incorrect in the finite variant since the owner is allowed to overwrite the value.
