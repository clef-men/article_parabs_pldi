\section{Benchmarks}
\label{app:benchmarks}

In this section, we present simple benchmarks to assess the performance of \Parabs relatively to \Domainslib and \Moonpool on simple workloads. Benchmarking concurrent schedulers is a subtle and difficult entreprise; we have not tried here to validate and expose experimentally the relevant of all our implementation choices, or to cover the wide range of concurrent workloads, but to validate a simple qualitative claim:

\begin{quotation}
  \Parabs has comparable performance to \Domainslib, a state-of-the-art scheduler used in production in the \OCamlFive library ecosystem.
