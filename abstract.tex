We present the implementation and verification of a realistic parallel scheduler for \OCamlFive using the \Iris-based \Zoo framework.
Similarly to \Domainslib, it relies on a work-stealing strategy to perform load balancing but also supports other scheduling strategies thanks to its flexible interface.
We provide basic benchmarks demonstrating that its performance is on par with other schedulers from the \OCaml ecosystem.

As part of this effort, we verify the Chase-Lev work-stealing deque, as implemented in the \Saturn library.
We show that it features a subtle external and future-dependent linearization point.
To deal with it, we introduce new abstractions for reasoning about prophecy variables in \Iris.
