We present the implementation and mechanized verification of a realistic parallel scheduler for OCaml 5 using the Iris-based Zoo framework.  Similarly to Domainslib, it relies on a work-stealing strategy to perform load balancing but also supports other scheduling strategies thanks to its flexible interface.  e provide basic benchmarks demonstrating that its performance is on par with other schedulers from the OCaml ecosystem.

As part of this effort, we verify the Chase-Lev work-stealing deque, as implemented in the Saturn library.  We show that it features a subtle external and future-dependent linearization point.  To deal with it, we introduce new abstractions for reasoning about prophecy variables in Iris.
