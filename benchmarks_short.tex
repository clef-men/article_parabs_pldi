\section{Benchmarks}
\label{sec:benchmarks}

We ran several concurrent benchmarks exercising three scheduler implementations: our own \Parabs scheduler, the reference \Domainslib library, and its alternative \Moonpool. The benchmark results validate our qualitative claim that the performance of \Parabs is on par with that of \Domainslib; we found that it is as efficient, and even slightly faster on some benchmarks.

For reasons of space we will not detail our benchmark results here, we relegated a more detailed description of our benchmarks and results to \cref{app:benchmarks}.
