\section{\Parabs: A library of parallel abstractions}
\label{sec:parabs}

We present the verified \Parabs library~\refLibTheories{zoo_parabs}, offering parallel abstractions atop a task scheduler.
While it was originally based on \Domainslib~\citep{domainslib}, it evolved as a more ambitious project aimed at unifying various existing paradigms and scheduling strategies.
It was designed with a focus on \emph{flexibility}, letting users choose the scheduling strategy and build their own scheduler.
One of the motivations of this design is to provide a framework to easily develop and experiment parallel infrastructures in \OCamlFive.
